#  Bike Buyers Data Analysis â€“ Excel Dashboard Project

##  Project Overview
This is my first data analysis project, designed to explore demographic and behavioral patterns behind bicycle purchases using Excel. The goal was to transform raw data into meaningful insights through data cleaning, exploration, pivoting, and visualization.

##  Tools & Skills Used
- **Microsoft Excel**
  - Data Cleaning & Transformation
  - Pivot Tables
  - Slicers
  - Data Visualization
- **Basic Statistics**
- **Segmentation & Pattern Recognition**

##  Workflow

1. **Raw Data** (`bike_buyers` sheet)
   - Contains original customer records
2. **Cleaned Sheet** (`Working Sheet`)
   - Cleaned column values
   - Added age brackets for segmentation
3. **Pivot Table**
   - Explored average income by purchase status
   - Identified trends by region, age group, and education
4. **Dashboard** *(in progress)*
   - Will visualize key insights interactively using slicers, bar charts, and pie charts

##  Key Insights
- Higher bike purchase rates among **middle-aged professionals**.
- Shorter commute distances correlate with higher likelihood of buying a bike.
- Income and education level also show notable trends.

## Next Steps
- Finish and polish the dashboard layout.
- Convert this project into a **Power BI** version.
- Expand analysis using **SQL** and **Python**.
